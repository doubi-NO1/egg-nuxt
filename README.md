# egg-nuxt-lib

## Description
- Based on [@liyanlong's nuxt-egg](https://github.com/liyanlong/nuxt-egg)
- Because of that lib doesn't work with the latest version of Eggjs & Nuxtjs yet. So I'v created a new lib here.

### What is Egg.js
- Better enterprise frameworks and apps with Node.js & Koa.
- For more infomation please visit [eggjs.org](https://eggjs.org/en/index.html).

### What is Nuxt.js

- Nuxt.js is a framework for creating Universal Vue.js Applications.

- Its main scope is UI rendering while abstracting away the client/server distribution.

- Our goal is to create a framework flexible enough that you can use it as a main project base or in addition to your current project based on Node.js.

- Nuxt.js presets all the configuration needed to make your development of a Vue.js Application Server Rendered more enjoyable.

- In addition, we also provide another deployment option called: nuxt generate. It will build a Static Generated Vue.js Application. We believe that option could be the next big step in the development of Web Applications with microservices.

- As a framework, Nuxt.js comes with a lot of features to help you in your development between the client side and the server side such as Asynchronous Data, Middleware, Layouts, etc.
